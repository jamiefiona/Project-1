    On another hiking path, we climbed to the top and we were able to see
    <br>San Francisco in the distance. To think this place was only 1 hour away from
    <br>the city is incredible. When I move, I would love to live in a place like this
    <br>where I can escape the <a href="index1.html">city life</a> whenever I want to.
