        This week I learned some of the basic functions of HTML which was helpful since
        <br> I have no coding experience. Using html:5 for a starting point of the code was cool 
        <br>to learn since it acts as a template for the rest of the code. The most interesting thing 
        <br>to learn was how to import an image into the code and resize it for the website. One 
        <br>of the harder things to remember is closing off the code line with “>” and separating parts 
        <br>with the semicolon. At this point, I don’t think I can remember all these new functions but 
        <br>over time it will become more natural once I keep coding.
    </div>
    <br>
    <div>
        I am still kind of confused with the “style” page and what else you can do on there that you 
        <br>can’t do in the main page of coding. We were able to change the color of the text there but 
        <br>I don’t exactly remember how to link the “style” page back to the main page coding. I am 
        <br>still unsure of what it means to push the code to github, like does it show all the lines of
        <br>coding in a text format or does it link a file to the visual studio program? Once we do more 
        <br>coding and upload it to github it should be more clear to me. I want to learn how to change 
        <br>the font and position of text on a webpage and make more “click-through” links.

        This week we learned a lot about different styling techniques like changing font styles,
        <br>font colors, backgrounds, how to position text boxes (relative, absolute, sticky), arefs,
        <br>divs, paragraph tags, and class styles. It was all a lot of content that seemed easy 
        <br>enough at first but once I started the two exercises about the poem and the story,
        <br>it was confusing on where to place things. And I forget exactly what each styling does. 
        <br>I will need to reference the website W3 schools because all the coding language is still
        <br>confusing to me. I think the exercises will actually take me much longer than I expected. 
        </div>
        <br>
        <div>
            Learning how to size images with either percentages or pixels was helpful but I am not 
            <br>used to manually typing size dimensions. For the two exercises I am not sure what ideas 
            <br>I have in mind, especially for the 5 variations of a poem. The examples shown seem very 
            <br>complicated and I have no idea how they arranged all that on one page through code. 
            <br>I definitely felt the learning curve of coding this week and feel like I need a reference 
            <br>sheet by my side so I remember where to place coding lines so that they actually link 
            <br>and perform the action I want. The hardest thing for me is probably switching between 
            <br>the css styling page to the index page and making sure they are linked in the areas I 
            <br>want to style. This will just take time to get used to but I still feel like such a newbie 
            <br>with all this stuff.

        This week we did exercises 1 and 2 which allowed me to experiment with css styling
        <br>and text links. Exercise 1 with the hyperlinks was pretty easy to learn as long as I just
        <br>linked the pages together and created new pages for each link. Exercise 2 was a little harder
        <br>because I had to look up how to correctly place the stylings in the html file or in the css page. 
        <br>But through this, I was able to learn how to change font color, bold/italicize words, create 
        <br>borders with different styles/colors, and create colored backgrounds. In future exercises, I 
        <br>would like to space out the words more on the page like in the center or towards the right.
    </div>
    <br>
    <div>
        We also learned about flex containers and how this is an easy way to style a group of words 
        <br>all together instead of styling each one individually. I like how easy it was to create 
        <br>a class for the whole flex container because it saves time for styling. I will definitely 
        <br>want to use this for some aspects of project 1 when I want to group text together with 
        <br>the same style like font, background color, and alignment. Thinking about project 1,
        <br>I want to do something in a fun style that is different from my professional art website
        <br>currently. Maybe a pixel art related aspect or make it have a retro gaming feel. I think 
        <br>this will be a fun way to experiment with new css, animations, and unique features 
        <br>that I can’t do with my other squarespace website that is locked behind templates.

        This week we learned about jquery functions which is helpful
        <br>when you want to have actions done with the mouse cursor on
        <br>things on the page. The punctuation  for jquery is still confusing
        <br>with the placement of things but once I use it more I think I will
        <br>get the hang of it. I like how jquery allows me to add different 
        <br>functions easily once I know the selector and action part. I will 
        <br>have to test it out more to see what other things I can do with 
        <br>jquery. I like the toggle button function that animates the text to 
        <br>dissolve into itself. I want to learn more animation techniques 
        <br>which is probably when we learn about javascript. 
    </div>
    <br>
    <div>
        As I was working on project 1, I learned how to add modals that 
        <br>I can use to open up boxes to place my exercises in. I am trying to 
        <br>make the modals open up with a click on an icon that I hand draw 
        <br>and add as an image. I am not sure yet how to display my exercises 
        <br>through the modal, like if I link the href tag to the html page for the 
        <br>exercise or another way. I am not sure exactly how to place my icons 
        <br>in different areas on the page. They are just below each other which I 
        <br>don’t like the look of that much so I will have to look up a tutorial on 
        <br>how to place them in different areas. Once we learn about some 
        <br>javascript next Monday, that may give me a few more ideas for
        <br>project 1 to either implement animations or functions to my website. 
        <br>Lastly, I want to learn how to change the cursor of the mouse to 
        <br>another cursor when it hovers over different things.

        This week I worked on project 1 where I had to troubleshoot my modals 
        <br>to pop open on a click of an icon, drew the icons in different colors, and 
        <br>added a hover effect that changes the colors of the icons. One of the 
        <br>hardest parts was learning how to get my modal to show exercise 2 
        <br>using jquery. I had to reference a lot of help from the internet on what I 
        <br>needed to input for my modal to show exercise 2 and add a scroll for the 
        <br>y-axis. To exit the modal, it has an “x” button on the top right but I want to 
        <br>find a way to exit the modal by just clicking away from it also. And I would 
        <br>like to see if I can find a way to drag around the modal while it’s open. 
        <br>Making my various drawn icons hover to change colors was hard at first 
        <br>using jquery but once I found out how to do 1, the other 5 were easy to do. 
        <br>Next, I will want to see if I can add an animation that makes the icons wiggle 
        <br>a little when you hover over them. Also with animations, I would like to find 
        <br>a way to change the cursor symbol to change when I hover over the 
        <br>icons or modals.
        <br>
        <br>
        I am not sure what else I want to add to my website yet besides the 2 
        <br>exercises we did for this class. I could maybe link my existing portfolio 
        <br>website pages or content for the other icons I have. I could also post 
        <br>some of my photos, video links, contact information, or interests to 
        <br>use as other content. For the next week, I still need to add the text 
        <br>headings for the icons, add the header bar at the top, and more 
        <br>content for the different modals, and do more styling/add more colors.

        This week I worked on the Drawing Shapes exercise where I tried to 
        <br>draw an ocean scene with the p5.js code. This process looked fun
        <br>at first but as I was doing it, it became very overcomplicated with 
        <br>all the details you need to input just to draw a shape. I am used to 
        <br>drawing with vectors in illustrator or just drawing digitally so having 
        <br>to draw with code seems very complicated when I can so easily do 
        <br>it in another program. I don’t like having to input every fill color, stroke, 
        <br>vertices, and lines for each shape just to draw something I want. 
        <br>Some of the ocean animals/elements I drew are a turtle, jellyfish, sea 
        <br>urchin, seaweed. I want to try to add some fish, shells, and maybe a 
        <br>shrimp or seahorse if I can find a nice way to make a curved line. 
        <br>The hardest part is making the more dynamic shapes with curves 
        <br>because they have so many numbers you have to input to make it the 
        <br>way you want. 
            <br>
            <br>
        <br>It is also hard to plan things out how I want it because I get frustrated when
        <br>it doesn’t look the way I thought it would. I think I should just keep drawing 
        <br>different shapes and use these to create new ocean elements that seem 
        <br>fitting so I can fill up the page more. Or even not everything has to be ocean 
        <br>related, I can have some other designs that are interesting to me that help 
        <br>make the drawing aesthetically pleasing to me. The coolest thing was using 
        <br>the gaussian math code to make an animated line that moves to act as the 
        <br>moving seaweed in the ocean.

    <div>
        This week we learned about functions in p5.js and how to make repeating 
        <br>shapes that draw in different places every time the page is refreshed. The 
        <br>functions for drawing the faces in the small face exercise was confusing on 
        <br>where to place the elements and label the functions. Like adding a new shape 
        <br>to draw, it was confusing on where I had to place the function or define it. 
        <br>I think the repeating shapes is an interesting function to play with because it acts 
        <br>as a random generator to draw shapes on its own. It’s way easier than drawing 
        <br>each shape individually and finding the correct placement for it. This makes me 
        <br>think of ideas for Exercise 5 where I can draw a few shapes and then use these 
        <br>new functions to repeat them randomly so they fill the whole page with an 
        <br>interesting design.
        <br>
        <br>
        Some ideas I have for Exercise 5 while using some of these new functions are 
        <br>expanding on my ocean idea. I can draw some shapes to create a jellyfish, 
        <br>shells, and fish and then use the repeating functions to randomize how they 
        <br>show up on the pages. And I can try to limit where each object shows up on 
        <br>the page through the math functions so that it doesn’t look too randomized. 
        <br>Similar to how a classmate did Exercise 4 where they had different layouts 
        <br>of the same shapes but it still looked orderly and designed well. Seeing 
        <br>other people’s ideas was very inspiring on what I can expand on for my 
        <br>Exercise 5 to try new things.

        This week I worked on Exercise 5 and experimented more with p5.js using
        <br>jitters, a parametric equation, wave graph, random gaussian, mouse movements, 
        <br>repeating shapes, and key press colors. I spent a lot of time looking at the p5.js 
        <br>examples and references to experiment with a lot of new things that draw on their 
        <br>own each time you refresh the page. It got confusing when I tried to duplicate the 
        <br>repeating shapes of my shell shape because it broke my code when I tried to add 
        <br>another repeating drawing. I tried to use different drawing layers and put them in 
        <br>the same one but it still would not draw 2 different repeating shapes. Experimenting 
        <br>with parameters and functions in p5.js was interesting to see how many different 
        <br>things you can do with it to draw unique things but it is still confusing on where to 
        <br>place everything so that the code doesn’t break.
        <br>
        <br>
        I liked what I did for Exercise 5 because it is chaotic and fun having a lot of different 
        <br>elements draw by themselves and to see how the page changes with each refresh. 
        <br>My favorite is the repeating shapes of my shell because experimenting with the 
        <br>various options for the bottom curved shape was fun to see how weird the shape 
        <br>could look. I want to experiment with more mouse functions like drawing with the 
        <br>mouse or having various actions happen when you click and drag the mouse to 
        <br>create shapes or a path. Since this exercise was about experimentation, I want my 
        <br>final project to have more of a plan or theme.
