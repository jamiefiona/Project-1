        This week I learned some of the basic functions of HTML which was helpful since
        <br> I have no coding experience. Using html:5 for a starting point of the code was cool 
        <br>to learn since it acts as a template for the rest of the code. The most interesting thing 
        <br>to learn was how to import an image into the code and resize it for the website. One 
        <br>of the harder things to remember is closing off the code line with “>” and separating parts 
        <br>with the semicolon. At this point, I don’t think I can remember all these new functions but 
        <br>over time it will become more natural once I keep coding.
    </div>
    <br>
    <div>
        I am still kind of confused with the “style” page and what else you can do on there that you 
        <br>can’t do in the main page of coding. We were able to change the color of the text there but 
        <br>I don’t exactly remember how to link the “style” page back to the main page coding. I am 
        <br>still unsure of what it means to push the code to github, like does it show all the lines of
        <br>coding in a text format or does it link a file to the visual studio program? Once we do more 
        <br>coding and upload it to github it should be more clear to me. I want to learn how to change 
        <br>the font and position of text on a webpage and make more “click-through” links.

        This week we learned a lot about different styling techniques like changing font styles,
        <br>font colors, backgrounds, how to position text boxes (relative, absolute, sticky), arefs,
        <br>divs, paragraph tags, and class styles. It was all a lot of content that seemed easy 
        <br>enough at first but once I started the two exercises about the poem and the story,
        <br>it was confusing on where to place things. And I forget exactly what each styling does. 
        <br>I will need to reference the website W3 schools because all the coding language is still
        <br>confusing to me. I think the exercises will actually take me much longer than I expected. 
        </div>
        <br>
        <div>
            Learning how to size images with either percentages or pixels was helpful but I am not 
            <br>used to manually typing size dimensions. For the two exercises I am not sure what ideas 
            <br>I have in mind, especially for the 5 variations of a poem. The examples shown seem very 
            <br>complicated and I have no idea how they arranged all that on one page through code. 
            <br>I definitely felt the learning curve of coding this week and feel like I need a reference 
            <br>sheet by my side so I remember where to place coding lines so that they actually link 
            <br>and perform the action I want. The hardest thing for me is probably switching between 
            <br>the css styling page to the index page and making sure they are linked in the areas I 
            <br>want to style. This will just take time to get used to but I still feel like such a newbie 
            <br>with all this stuff.

        This week we did exercises 1 and 2 which allowed me to experiment with css styling
        <br>and text links. Exercise 1 with the hyperlinks was pretty easy to learn as long as I just
        <br>linked the pages together and created new pages for each link. Exercise 2 was a little harder
        <br>because I had to look up how to correctly place the stylings in the html file or in the css page. 
        <br>But through this, I was able to learn how to change font color, bold/italicize words, create 
        <br>borders with different styles/colors, and create colored backgrounds. In future exercises, I 
        <br>would like to space out the words more on the page like in the center or towards the right.
    </div>
    <br>
    <div>
        We also learned about flex containers and how this is an easy way to style a group of words 
        <br>all together instead of styling each one individually. I like how easy it was to create 
        <br>a class for the whole flex container because it saves time for styling. I will definitely 
        <br>want to use this for some aspects of project 1 when I want to group text together with 
        <br>the same style like font, background color, and alignment. Thinking about project 1,
        <br>I want to do something in a fun style that is different from my professional art website
        <br>currently. Maybe a pixel art related aspect or make it have a retro gaming feel. I think 
        <br>this will be a fun way to experiment with new css, animations, and unique features 
        <br>that I can’t do with my other squarespace website that is locked behind templates.

        This week we learned about jquery functions which is helpful
        <br>when you want to have actions done with the mouse cursor on
        <br>things on the page. The punctuation  for jquery is still confusing
        <br>with the placement of things but once I use it more I think I will
        <br>get the hang of it. I like how jquery allows me to add different 
        <br>functions easily once I know the selector and action part. I will 
        <br>have to test it out more to see what other things I can do with 
        <br>jquery. I like the toggle button function that animates the text to 
        <br>dissolve into itself. I want to learn more animation techniques 
        <br>which is probably when we learn about javascript. 
    </div>
    <br>
    <div>
        As I was working on project 1, I learned how to add modals that 
        <br>I can use to open up boxes to place my exercises in. I am trying to 
        <br>make the modals open up with a click on an icon that I hand draw 
        <br>and add as an image. I am not sure yet how to display my exercises 
        <br>through the modal, like if I link the href tag to the html page for the 
        <br>exercise or another way. I am not sure exactly how to place my icons 
        <br>in different areas on the page. They are just below each other which I 
        <br>don’t like the look of that much so I will have to look up a tutorial on 
        <br>how to place them in different areas. Once we learn about some 
        <br>javascript next Monday, that may give me a few more ideas for
        <br>project 1 to either implement animations or functions to my website. 
        <br>Lastly, I want to learn how to change the cursor of the mouse to 
        <br>another cursor when it hovers over different things.

        This week I worked on project 1 where I had to troubleshoot my modals 
        <br>to pop open on a click of an icon, drew the icons in different colors, and 
        <br>added a hover effect that changes the colors of the icons. One of the 
        <br>hardest parts was learning how to get my modal to show exercise 2 
        <br>using jquery. I had to reference a lot of help from the internet on what I 
        <br>needed to input for my modal to show exercise 2 and add a scroll for the 
        <br>y-axis. To exit the modal, it has an “x” button on the top right but I want to 
        <br>find a way to exit the modal by just clicking away from it also. And I would 
        <br>like to see if I can find a way to drag around the modal while it’s open. 
        <br>Making my various drawn icons hover to change colors was hard at first 
        <br>using jquery but once I found out how to do 1, the other 5 were easy to do. 
        <br>Next, I will want to see if I can add an animation that makes the icons wiggle 
        <br>a little when you hover over them. Also with animations, I would like to find 
        <br>a way to change the cursor symbol to change when I hover over the 
        <br>icons or modals.
        <br>
        <br>
        I am not sure what else I want to add to my website yet besides the 2 
        <br>exercises we did for this class. I could maybe link my existing portfolio 
        <br>website pages or content for the other icons I have. I could also post 
        <br>some of my photos, video links, contact information, or interests to 
        <br>use as other content. For the next week, I still need to add the text 
        <br>headings for the icons, add the header bar at the top, and more 
        <br>content for the different modals, and do more styling/add more colors.

    <div>
            This week I finished up Project 1 and focused on adding more modals for
            <br>the icons and href links that take you to another page. It was cool to see
            <br>what things I could add to the modals including a YouTube video, a weather
            <br>widget, a game widget, and other html pages for my exercises. I drew some
            <br>new icons for the weather, music, and illustration labels so that I would 
            <br>have more content to click on for interaction. On the right side of the page,
            <br>I drew two blobs that move and change color when you hover over them 
            <br>similar to how my icons move. I made these designs large so they fill the 
            <br>white space when there is not a modal showing since it will take up that 
            <br>space instead. To format my icons and labels how I wanted on the page, I 
            <br>used tables to divide the icons and labels into rows so they are all inline
            <br>with each other. I used the same method for the task bar on the bottom. 
            <br>
            <br>
            I had to put my two large blob designs in the same table as my left icons 
            <br>because I wanted them all inline with each other. But because the blobs 
            <br>are in a table, it was hard to position them to stay in place when the 
            <br>window gets smaller. This is not a big problem for me since I want to 
            <br>look at my website in full screen but if I learned how to make it stay 
            <br>in place later on, I will want to fix this. Overall, I really like how my
            <br>project turned out since this is my first time creating a website using 
            <br>HTML. I also liked how I was able to incorporate my hand drawn 
            <br>designs because it makes the website feel more personal to me.
