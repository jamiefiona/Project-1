    We started climbing the tall hill, following the small walking path
    <br>with yellow grass surrounding us. I walked slowy behind my friend
    <br>taking numerous photos of the area, but I began to hurry foward as I
    <br>started to see the layers of <a href="clouds.html">clouds</a> over the horizon.
