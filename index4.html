            Luminous Night is a glowing nature scene with moving fireflies, trees, mountains, and a soft melody in the background. 
            <br>I wanted to create a calming scene with some moving elements to make it feel alive. My color palette includes cool 
            <br>tone colors with some lighter glowing blue, purple, green, and pink contrasted with the dark blue background to set 
            <br>the glowing night scene. The main movements are the fireflies that are jitterbugs, a mountain range made up of 
            <br>noise, pine trees made with random gaussian, a firefly that can move with the arrow keys and another one that 
            <br>moves with the mouse. The cursor firefly has a pink glowing trail when the mouse is pressed while the keyed firefly 
            <br>has a yellow moving trail based on the semi-transparent background I set. I drew a custom firefly cursor in Adobe 
            <br>Illustrator and saved it as a png to use in my coding to create the firefly. The final touch was adding a sound button 
            <br>to play music that helps create a serene night scene.
